# Reciprocating Engine Kinetic Extruder Visualizer

Kinetic extruder visualizer for a more interactive look, inspired by extruder visualizers from other designers.

The engine block is held in place by 2 circular tabs that press fit into the screw holes of standard NEMA 17 stepper motors. The fit should be tight so the assembly holds itself in place securely. If the mounting tabs don't fit in your motor, edit the tab size at openjscad.org as described below.

The crankshaft requires an **8 mm** diameter by **3 mm** tall neodymium magnet to hold itself to the stepper motor shaft.

Added Thingiverse Customizer ability! Easily customize the engine to fit your motor right here in Thingiverse.

Edit: Feb 16th 2020
Added more versions with tighter tolerances. The original engine was rendered with 0.5 mm tolerances. Now choose between 0.5 mm, 0.4 mm, 0.3 mm, 0.2 mm and 0.1 mm tolerance. If you are unsure which one to choose, start with the 0.3 mm tolerance version.

Originally, this model was designed in OpenJSCAD. The `v-twin.jscad` file is now out of date and doesn't contain the new features of `v-twin.scad`. To customize the OpenJSCAD engine, load `v-twin.jscad` into the openjscad.org website and edit the parameters. Then choose an export format and click *Generate*, After that completes, click *Download*.
